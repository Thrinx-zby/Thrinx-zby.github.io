<p> So first a little about me. I am a trans woman and a huge fan of music, mostly metal. I run linux mint with KDE Plasma as my DE and am a big gamer.</p>
<p>I am really into philosiphy so I might end up writting about that in here one day, but this is my step into the indie web rivival so I gotta figure out where to go from here :p </p>
